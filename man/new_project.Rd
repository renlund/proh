\description{
This function sets up a project directory structure along with
  some files
}
\details{
This function sets up a folder with subfolders \itemize{
\item{cache: this is only used by knitr}
\item{calc: this is for storage of
  .rdat files}
\item{calc/autoload: this is for storage of inline values.
  Typically this folder will automatically be loaded in a first (uncached)
  chunk of the rapport file by \code{fetch_all}.}
\item{figure: for plots
  (also used by knitr)}
\item{recieved: typically this is were I put files
  given by clients}
\item{sent: this is were I store things sent to client.
  The function \code{send} will attach the current date to the pdf version of
  the rapport and put it in this directory. Optionally, \code{send} can zip
  the rapport along with the graphs and tables from their respective
  directory}
\item{table: for (human readable) tabulated data}
}
and creates, optionally, the files
\itemize{
\item{'rapport.rnw': the rapport file, can
  be changed to suit your needs, but is designed to have a first uncached
  chunk (by default called 'autoLoad') that executes \code{fetch_all()}}
\item{.Rprofile which will load and point proh to the source file}
\item{'references.bib': a template for bibTeX
  references}
\item{a .rsproj file with the project name: this is an RStudio
  project file, by starting this file RStudio will set the working directory
  and remember what documents you were looking at. There are settings to be
  made that can be project specific}
\item{.gitignore: a file that git uses
  to tell which files to ignore}
}
}
